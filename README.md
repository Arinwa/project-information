DA219B VT24 Full Stack Lab 2

This excercise is a simple application that uses a React front-end to access a back-end server and a database. Express server and MongoDB database were used in this excercise.

The back-end server's database consists of three collections and each collection has 5 documents in it.

Vite.js instead of webpack was used as the bundler.

To run the application:
1. Clone it
2. Unzip and open the folder in a code editor such as VS Code
3. Run: npm install in the terminal in the root directory
4. Change directory to the 'client' and run: npm install
5. Run: npm run dev
6. Change directory back to the root and run: npm start
4. Open your browser on: http://localhost:5000/
